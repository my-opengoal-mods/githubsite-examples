## General Changes

### Add `--iso-path` Parameter for `goalc` <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/3692"/>

The compiler can now be given a custom ISO path with the new `--iso-path` command line parameter.

## Custom Levels

### Support for Compressed GLB Files <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/3723"/>

Custom levels now support using compressed GLB files by utilizing Google's [Draco Library](https://google.github.io/draco/) for 3D model compression, saving tons of space.

### Miscellaneous Bug Fixes <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/3736"/>

- Metallic textures will now be resized automatically to match the base color's texture size.
- Fix cases with bad vertex colors/alphas in certain spots.
- When changing scale on some objects in Blender, the length of exported normals would sometimes be wrong, so they are now normalized first.

## Jak 2

### Make Turret Controls Respect Camera Settings <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/3715"/>

After entering a gunpod, the camera will now use the correct settings as defined in the Camera Options menu.

## Jak 3

We're getting close to fixing all of the (known) remaining graphics issues. This month, most of the bug fixes revolved around fixing or implementing missing/broken graphics features.

### Fix `maker` Projectile Flashing <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/3702"/>

Due to a bad rotation value, whenever a projectile from one of the Dark Makers during the Defend Spargus mission was visible, a nauseating effect would be drawn over the screen.

### Merc Fade Support <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/3710"/>

"Merc Fade" is a transparency effect on foreground models, used for example to make Jak invisible when interacting with a Dark Maker idol.

### Fix `kleever-diaper` Secret <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/3713"/>

A small decompilation error resulted in the "Kleiver's Diaper" secret not working as intended.

The texture for the player cursor on the world map now shows up properly.

### Fix `neo-sat` Particles and Ropes <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/3722"/>

During the Dark Satellite fight in the desert, the particle effect when it smashes into the ground and the ropes were not drawing correctly.
