_Jak 2_ was first released in October 14, 2003. However, throughout the game's distribution different versions of the game were printed onto retail copies. There were in total **four** different versions released, in order:

- **NTSC-U v1** (first print): Built [month] [year]. This is the version of the game that was produced first and distributed in NTSC-U markets when it first released.
- **PAL**: Built [month] [year]. This is the second version of the game and was released in PAL markets.
- **NTSC-J**: Built [month] [year]. This is the third version of the game and was released in NTSC-J markets.
- **NTSC-U v2** (second print): Built [month] [year]. This is the fourth version of the game and was distributed on re-prints of the game in NTSC-U markets, such as the "Greatest Hits" re-release which features red packaging ("red label").

While OpenGOAL supports all these versions of the game, there will still be in-game differences depending on the version you use.

This page lists the differences between each version and between the original game and OpenGOAL (except for graphics rendering differences and brand new features which apply to all versions).
